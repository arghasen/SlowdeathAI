From BearTheGreat tutorial
1. Defconst Rules.  Constants must be defined before they can be used in rules or else they will generate an error message, so they really need to be at the top of the file.
2. Starting Strategic Numbers.  Strategic numbers really can go anywhere in the file, but I tend to put the ones defined early in the game at this location in the list.
3. Market Rules.  Put them here so you can buy or sell items as needed for research items.
4. Economy Rules (i.e. - Gatherer Rules)  They could really go anywhere.  I just choose to put them here.
5. Research Rules.  I think it is very important to put these before the training rules so you don't end up with lots of un-upgraded units.
6. Escrow Rules - It is best to place these after the research rules because escrow is usually held for research items.  It is nice to know when it can be released.
7. Build Rules - I find it very necessary to build before training so that I will have the resources to build.
8. Training Rules.  I usually train civilian units first to keep the economy humming.
9. Taunting Rules. 
10. Resignation Rules.  These really could go anywhere in the file.
11. Town-Size Rules.  These could also go anywhere.
12. Defend Rules.  These could also go anywhere.
13. Counter-Attack Rules.  These could also go anywhere.
14. Attack Rules.  These could also go anywhere.
